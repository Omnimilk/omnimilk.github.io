# Bonfire

Cannot move my eyes away from the bonfire

It was his will

It is a dance of life and death

It would be ashes of bodies

It is not an illusion as long as it burns

But I had stared at it for too long

So I lit my hand

And walked into the dark

As my lights going dimmer and dimmer

How I wish it is a cool autumn

I would just fall down on the ground

And flare up the whole forest
